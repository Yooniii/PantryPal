# PantryPal
PantryPal is simple web application created using Python, Flask, Jinja2, HTML, and CSS, that generates three recipe ideas using most of the user-provided ingredients. Recipes can be customized according to dietary preferences and pantry staples. Each recipe provides a section for ingredients, missing ingredients (if any), and brief instructions.

Future features I plan to incorporate: functionality that allows users to buy missing ingredients (either online or 
allow them to check nearby grocery stores with real-time stock updates.)
